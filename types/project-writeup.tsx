      <p>
        Concaly is a convention planning tool for artists and vendors. It
        aggregates data for 2,000+ cons and helps users visualize deadlines,
        travel, and booth schedules on a responsive map and calendar.
      </p>
    ),
    why: (
      <p>
        Most con tracking tools are outdated, hard to navigate, or exist in
        spreadsheets. I built Concaly to offer a modern, centralized tool that
        scales with the growing con circuit and artist community needs.

    what: (
      <p>
        In the summer of 2024, I thru-hiked the{" "}
        <strong>Pacific Crest Trail</strong> ‚Äî a 2650 mile journey from Mexico
        to Canada. I walked through the desert, slept in thunderstorms, forded
        rivers and climbed the tallest peak in the continental US. I also sewed
        the backpack, sleeping bag and tent that got me through the hike.
      </p>
    ),
    why: (
      <>
        <p>There were 2 things that really stuck with me:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 py-2">
          <li>
            <strong>I can do hard things</strong>. The hike was hard in more
            ways than one ‚Äî from rats chewing through my gear to running low on
            water. I was scared, lonely and in pain many days. I didn't have
            confidence, <strong>yet I still did it</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I'm not in control</strong>. I spent so much time worrying
            about food resupplies, river crossings, and fires. Yet, as big as
            those problems are, it's <strong>out of my hands</strong>. I can
            only move forward. And strangely enough, things tended to work out.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="pt-4">
          I think what I really learned was courage: moving forward despite
          fear, and letting go of control when nothing felt certain. I didn‚Äôt
          come off trail feeling more confident or self-assured. But I did learn
          how to keep going anyway.
