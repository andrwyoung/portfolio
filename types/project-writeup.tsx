    what: (
      <p>
        Concaly is a convention planning tool for artists and vendors. It
        aggregates data for 2,000+ cons and helps users visualize deadlines,
        travel, and booth schedules on a responsive map and calendar.
      </p>
    ),
    why: (
      <p>
        Most con tracking tools are outdated, hard to navigate, or exist in
        spreadsheets. I built Concaly to offer a modern, centralized tool that
        scales with the growing con circuit and artist community needs.
